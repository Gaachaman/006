                    <p>Niigata Prefecture is a rice-producing region, ranking first in Japan in terms of cultivated area, harvest volume, and agricultural output.
                        The Echigo Plain is a vast granary, and the rivers that flow through it provide water rich in nutrients, which nurtures rice with a rich taste. In particular, Koshihikari rice grown in Uonuma is produced in an environment suitable for rice cultivation due to the abundant melt water from heavy snowfall and the temperature difference between day and night, which contribute to high-quality rice production.

                    <p>
                        It is a cut soba served in a bowl called a hegi, and uses funori (laver) as the binder. It is said to be a local dish originating from the Uonuma region, born from the fusion of Niigata Prefecture's textile culture and soba-eating culture.

                    <p>
                        This Italian dish is loved by the people of Niigata Prefecture as a "B gourmet" dish. Unlike pasta, this spaghetti-style yakisoba is made with thick Chinese noodles, stir-fried like yakisoba noodles with sauce, and topped with meat sauce.

                    <p>
                        Poppoyaki is a kind of long, thin, sticky, steamed bread often seen at fairs and food stalls in Niigata. The name "Poppo-yaki" comes from the steamy appearance of the steam rising from the pan, which resembles a steam locomotive. Whenever Niigata residents go to a festival, they always buy some to take home. Especially in the snowy weather, it is a happy experience to pay a visit to the shrine on New Year's Day while eating warm Poppoyaki.

                    <p>
                        Sasa dumplings are made from two types of rice, less sticky Uruchi rice and glutinous rice. They are wrapped in bamboo leaves and tied with sedge or other string to form an easy-to-carry bale shape.
